# Day-25 Cloud with DevOps

Okay, now that we have finished the networking portion, let's move on to the next DevOps stage, which is cloud technologies. In DevOps, cloud technologies are also crucial.

## Why Cloud in DevOps? ☁
As I discussed in my first day blog, DevOps is a combination of tools and methodologies that helps to deliver solutions faster to the market. But what makes it faster and more reliable is the adoption of cloud technologies.

Ok so to understand it more clearly let's count the benefits of Cloud computing. Cloud computing basically means delivering various computing services like storage, computing, networking, etc, over the internet. 

**Example time**: 
Suppose you are starting your own tech startup. You have your product website, and you want to make it available for everyone. For that you need to host your product site. For hosting your site, you need servers, right?

![Spend higher](https://media.giphy.com/media/26nfp8HGGHLPGY2KQ/giphy.gif)

For that you have to spend high **CapEx**(Capital Expenditure). Ok, you purchased the servers, and your startup is growing at good growth rate. If your product is related to e-commerce site, then you may face one major problem which is in-consistent web traffic on your site. On festival days your site faces huge web load, and it makes your site slow or maybe sometimes you have to face downtime on your site.

So, you would go for purchasing more servers. Like you purchased 200 servers, but your web traffic was satisfied by 180 servers then that extra server resources are wasted.

  Cloud computing can solve your problem easily. What if you change your decision to purchase your own servers and rather go to rent server for your product site hosting. You will only have to pay for what you are consuming. How good is that right! And it also solves your problem whenever you face higher load you just have to rent more servers and if servers are extra then you can remove them from your plan.

This same concept works in cloud computing. With cloud computing you can save you lots of money and directly switch to **OpEx**(Operational Expenditure) model from **CapEx**. This cost model is also known as **Pay-As-You-Go**.

Some other benefits of Cloud Computing:
- Higher availability
- Fault Tolerance
- Zero downtime policy
- Higher Security

And this all are major key factors which are required in DevOps. It makes the implementation of DevOps simpler by empowering each step of the development lifecycle. It helps DevOps engineer to test the application on various environments to Virtualization. 

It also gives better collaboration; teams can work on the same project from anywhere in the globe. One more thing you don't need to worry about underlying infrastructure because it is handled by the cloud provider. That's a big relief for a person like me.

There are many cloud providers available like **AWS**, **Azure**, **GCP**, **IBM Cloud**, etc. But in this cloud with DevOps blog series, we will go with **Azure**.

So that was all for today. Tomorrow we will look for types of cloud, cloud computing models. So, stay tuned for tomorrow.
