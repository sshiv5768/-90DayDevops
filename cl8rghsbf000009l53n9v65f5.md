## Day-12 Basic Linux Commands for DevOps part-1

Yesterday, we discussed the value of Linux in DevOps and how to install Linux on a personal computer. We'll look at several Linux commands today that are helpful for DevOps. I'll merely go through the fundamental commands; not all of them. 

## Linux Commands üë®‚Äçüíª
If you wish to learn these commands, you must practise them frequently.


- **echo `Your_Text`** : To display line of text passed as a argument
```
echo "Hello, Dev!"
```
- **pwd** : To get current working directory
```
pwd
>> users/shivlal/Desktop
```
- **ls** : to display a complete list of every folder and file currently present in the current directory. You can add flags like ``ls -a `` for more advance list which also shows hidden files.
```
ls
ls -a
ls -all
```
- **cd `directory_name`** : To move from one directory to another.
Here few things are important to remember. If you want to go to previous directory you don't need to mention whole name just put ``..`` after cd. If you want to go to ``root`` directory you just need to add ``/`` and if you want to move to ``home`` directory add ``~``.

```
cd Desktop
>>

pwd
>> users/shivlal/Desktop

cd ~
>>

pwd
>> /home/users/shivlal

```

- **mkdir `directory_name`** : To make a new folder or a new directory
```
mkdir 90DaysOfDevOps
```
- **touch `file_name`** : To create a new file without any content.
```
touch p1.txt
```
- **cat >> `file_name`** : To create a new file with content. It is not only used for just creating file with content but also for displaying file content, merge the contents of multiple files, append one file's content to other file. 
```
  cat >> p1.txt
  >> This is just a simple txt file.
```
- **mv `file_name` `path` ** : To move a file to a specific path.
```
mv p1.txt  ..\Documents
```
- ** rm `file_name`: To remove the file.

```
rm p1.txt

```
