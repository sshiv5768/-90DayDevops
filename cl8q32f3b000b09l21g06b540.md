## Open-Source projects for Hacktoberfest'22

Open-source month is here again. Though I am an active open-source contributor, I still wait for this month. Because Hacktoberfest is not just about contributing to open source. There are a lot of things happening, like open-source talks, networking with experienced people, and most importantly, Swags. ðŸ¤©.
