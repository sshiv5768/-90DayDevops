# Day-18 Text Editors in Linux

Ok, we saw about file systems and file permissions, but now suppose you want to change or edit a file. How would you do that?
We can do that using text-editors. There are a lot of text-editors available, like Vim, Nano, Gedit, VScode, GNU emacs, etc. However, we will only look at three editors: **Vim**, **Nano**, and **Gedit**.Â 

## Gedit
The GNOME desktop environment comes with the Gedit editor by default. Whenever you open a file, it will open with the Gedit editor. It offers simple features similar to those of a standard text editor.

```
gedit <file_name>

```

## Vim
It is one of the most popular and effective command-line editors. The majority of Linux distributions by default support it. It is user-friendly and offers the same layout for all Linux distributions.

The vim editor, sometimes referred to as a programmer's editor, supports the majority of file types. According to our needs, we can use its plugin. It is also the most difficult one. Seriously, when I was learning it, my major issue was how to exit it ðŸ˜…

### Installation
