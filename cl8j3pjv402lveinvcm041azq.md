## Day-7 Let's "Go"

We are going to start our programming journey with **Go** from today. But first let me clear few things, I am not going to describe whole installation process of **Go** why? Because it will make this blog very lengthy and second thing I am using Linux and there might be windows and MacOs users reading this blog so if i describe the Linux one than i also have to mention other OS processes and it will make this blog very lengthy. 

But don't be sad i will share few resource videos of installation process on different OSs. You will also require a code editor or IDE. I will go with VScode ([Click here to Install](https://code.visualstudio.com/)). Why i chose VScode because I am using it for long time so first advantage is that. Second one, it support multiple plugins and tools to support **Go lang**. If you don't want to install Vscode in your you can use its [web version](https://vscode.dev/) also.

Ok, you are ready with you tools then let's create our first Go program. I created a new folder in my Desktop named it ** Go practice **.
