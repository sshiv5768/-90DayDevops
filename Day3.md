## Day-3 DevOps Vs Agile

Yesterday we saw flaws of previous SDLCs methods with respect to DevOps. Agile method was one of them and it is strong competitor of DevOps. Although it is a strong contender, both have many things in common. Let's see that..

## What is Agile? 🤔
Agile focuses on dispatching small results faster rather than releasing one big interaction of the project. It mainly focuses on how fast you can develop and deliver your software by getting proper feedback from the end-user. It doesn't focus on operations, and that's the major issue with it, which creates miscommunication between the developer team and the operations team.

It uses frameworks and tools like **Scrum**, **Kanban **, ** Lean **.

## DevOps vs Agile ⚔️
Agile was developed earlier, like decades ago, but DevOps is quite recent, like in the 2000's. Both are SDLC's methodologies, so no much difference is there, but still, DevOps is better than Agile.

| Features     | Agile | DevOps     |
| :---        |    :----:   |          ---: |
| Feedback      | Feedback needed from customer      | Feedback needed from Internal team  |
| Team size   | Smaller team     | Larger team      |
| Focus   | Speed    | Speed and automation      |
| Tools and Frameworks | Scrum, Kanban, Lean, Crystal     | Git, Docker, Jenkins, Selenium, Kubernetes, Graphana, etc      |
