# Day-20 Networking in DevOps

So our journey of Linux in DevOps stops here. Now we are moving to a new path which is also an essential key skill for DevOps. I am talking about **Networking**(Internet Networking). It is a key fundamental of DevOps that we should have basic knowledge of various networking terms like switch, router, IP address, OSI model, DNS server, etc.

## Why Networking is Important in DevOps? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

The communication between two or more systems, whether they are servers or mobile, is known as networking, right! In DevOps we also have a process of continuous integration(CI) and continuous delivery(CD). In this phase our application or our software is continuously communicating with servers.

If something goes wrong during this communication, then our understanding of networking enables us to resolve the problem.

 That doesn't mean that only CI/CD utilise networking skills; practically every DevOps process makes use of them. From making a container-image to deploy that image, creating a CI/CD pipeline to creating a custom automation test cases, creating a virtual machines to host that virtual machines on cloud, almost every phase use networking.

And also you may heard about **NetDevOps** or **Network DevOps** term. I came upon this word while looking for something related to networking in DevOps. Applying DevOps techniques to networking, such as the test, monitor, and deploy phases in a network, is what it basically means.

In further blogs we will dive deeper and see about various networking terms like switches, routers, host, network, OSI model, etc.

That's all I have to say for today; I realise my blog is pretty short, but I didn't have much time to learn more. But I'll definitely talk about that in my upcoming blog. Until the next blog, take care.
