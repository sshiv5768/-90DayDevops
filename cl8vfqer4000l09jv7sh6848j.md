## 4 Funny Linux commands you should definitely try!

Hello to Everyone. As part of my ongoing [#90DaysOfDevOps](https://sshivlal.hashnode.dev/) challenge, I spent this week looking for fundamental Linux commands that can be helpful in DevOps. I discovered several amazing and humorous Linux commands while exploring, which you should also try.

## Figlet : ASCII art creator 
Perhaps on your terminal, there were lovely ASCII banners you might noticed during your work. By using "figlet," we may also accomplish that. User inputs are transformed into an ASCII banner using this.

```
sudo apt install figlet

figlet "your_text"

```

You must be familiar with the vintage animation seen above. It comes from the well-known film **The Matrix**. Using the "cmatrix" command, you may easily produce an animation of a similar style using other colours.

```
sudo apt install cmatrix

cmatrix
```

## Cowsay üêÆ
``cowsay`` is a command-line tool that uses ASCII art to display the supplied input with a cute cow image. Although there isn't much to this programme, you may use it as a Bash prompt whenever you open a new terminal instance by calling the programme with random quotes.

```
sudo apt install cowsay

cowsay "Moo"

```

## Espeak: Text-to-speech command line tool üîä
Have you ever wished that your Linux desktop would communicate to you in the exact words you desire? ``espeak`` is a text-to-speech tool that instantly produces speech from a given string when given one. 

```
sudo apt install espeak

espeak "Hello Shiv"

espeak " What can i do for you?"

```

That was all the fun and awesome Linux commands that i found this week. If you also have such commands do share it.
