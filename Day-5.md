## Day-5 Success Stories of DevOps

So today I am not going to write a big blog because it was really a heavy day for me. I just finished **Google Cloud Community Day '22**. Initially, I was not going to write this blog because of tiredness😩, but commitment is commitment 😤.

Today I will discuss two of the success stories of big, famous companies: How they started with DevOps and how it helped them to scale up their growth.

## Success Stories 📜

### Amazon (AWS) ☁️
The first company's name was easy to guess because a lot of us had heard about it. Amazon, during its early stages, used physical servers for their applications, but they didn't think that their business would go to scale rapidly. With rapid growth also comes rapid traffic on servers, which was tedious to handle for Amazon.

When their customer base was increasing slowly, it was tough to guess how much server capacity was needed to fulfil the current traffic. This led Amazon to waste server capacity. During normal days, they bought high server capacity but the traffic was less, but in festival seasons like Christmas, when there is double-triple load on servers, they needed to buy more server capacity.

This problem makes them want to find a solution that can auto-scale their server according to its needs. And AWS was invented. Initially it was for Amazon's personal use, but later they started renting servers to other users to deploy their projects. Later, they add more services to that, demonstrating that AWS is not a household name among IT professionals. 

### Netflix 🎬
Netflix is the next on the list. **Bella Ciao** is a well-known word throughout the world. The Spanish series is world famous, even in India also How is that possible? because of Netflix's online streaming platform.

Earlier, Netflix was selling DVDs, and they thought they should try something different. They started their own video streaming service but there were no tools available to support Netflix's infrastructure, so they went the open source way. They took the volunteer help of hundreds of developers and created a suite of automated open source tools known as [Simian Army](https://github.com/Netflix/SimianArmy). which helped them to automate their infrastructure and identify their vulnerabilities before they reached users.

After that, growth sky rocketed. Never forget that you are watching a series or a movie at the right date and right time without any fault because a lot of devops engineers are working on that.

### End Credits 👋
