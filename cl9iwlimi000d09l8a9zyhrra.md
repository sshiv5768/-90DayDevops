# Day-26 Types of Cloud Computing

Today we are going deeper with Cloud providers, Cloud types like **Public**, **Private** and **Hybrid** and **Community** cloud model. So, Let's dig into it.

## Different Cloud Providers
Although there are many cloud service providers on the market, AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud Provider (GCP) are now the top 3 companies in this sector. The majority of the [market share](https://www.wpoven.com/blog/cloud-market-share/) is held by these three companies, with AWS at 40%, Azure at 21.9%, and GCP at 5.5%. 

In this cloud blog series, we are going to continue our journey with [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/).

## Different Cloud Types
There are four different types of cloud available.

1. Public
2. Private
3. Hybrid
4. Community

### Public Cloud ‚õ≥
As we discussed in our previous blog if you purchase your own servers you have to pay high **CapEx** and you also have to spend money on hardware configurations, server maintenance and support staff. But if you go with Cloud model you just pay for what you use. 

This scanario comes under **public** cloud model, where you don't need to worry about management of hosting space and its maintenance. General public can easily access it through internet.

#### Advantages
- Pay-as-per-use model
- Location independent
- Administrated by third party cloud service provider
- Example: AWS, Microsoft Azure

#### Disadvantages
- Less Secure
- Loss of Control

### Private Cloud ü§ê
Unlike public cloud private cloud provides computing services to only selected users or selected organizations.

#### Advantages
- Highly secure
- More control over its resources and hardware
- Better performance than public cloud

#### Disadvantages
- Higher cost
- Need skilled people for maintaining it
-  Limited access to resources

### Hybrid Cloud üßµ
Ok, so looked both public and private clouds. What if you get benefits of both in one solution. That solution is **Hybrid Cloud**. It is combination of Public and Private clouds.

You can divide your tasks in hybrid cloud like if there are tasks that are very important and secure than you can do that on private cloud and if there are less important tasks then you can do that on public clouds. This is how hybrid cloud works.

#### Advantages
- Flexible
- Secure
- Better risk management
- Cost friendly 

#### Disadvantages
- Complex networking
- Infrastructure management (Handling both private and public cloud is tough work)

### Community Cloud üèõÔ∏è
Community term shows its actual definition. In a community a group of people share their knowledge, interests and help each other so that they can grow the community. Same principle applies to Community cloud.

It provides computing services to the grouped organizations or a community organization something like government organizations. It doesn't matter how many organizations are there in the community. All of them can access and share each other's resources, infrastructure.

#### Advantages
- Cost effective (Cost is divided among all the organizations in a community)
- Resource sharing
- More secure than public cloud

#### Disadvantages
- Not a good option for every organization
- Difficult to handle infrastructure

Okay, so this was all basic knowledge about cloud providers and their types. We will also look for **IaaS**, **PaaS** and **SaaS** in our next blog till then see you.
