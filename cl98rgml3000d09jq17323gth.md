# Day-21 Useful Networking Terms

Yesterday, we saw how Networking is useful in DevOps, now today we are going to look at some the basic Networking Devices and terms.

## Host
Basically host is a device who send and receive traffic over a network. Computer, mobile, printer, even though cloud servers are also an example of host.

IOT devices like sensors, smart lights, smart TV are also an example of host. You may be familiar with the client-server model. The client-server model is another well-known example of host. Client contacts the server with a request, and the server replies to the client.

## IP Address
IP address is like a home address of a each host device. Suppose one host device sent a request to the server and server also sent a response to that device. But one question comes here in my mind like? How did server recognized that device.

It all worked with the help of IP address. It is like a identity of a host device. It is 32bits long number containing numbers from 0-255 which are divided in 4 octets.

## Switches
A switch is like a delivery system in a network. Switches aid in network communication. Data packets are forwarded via switches between hosts. Direct packet transmission to hosts is accomplished by a switch.

## Routers 
The communication between networks is facilitated by routers. Since a switch manages communication within a network, a router enables us to connect these networks together or, if allowed, at least to grant them access to one another.

A router can act as a traffic control point for security, filtering, and redirection.

So this was all about basic networking terms, I know I haven't covered all the terms like still Hub,OSI model, Net protocols, DNS, Subnets are remaining. I will cover that in next blog.
