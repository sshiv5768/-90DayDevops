## Day-8  Dive Deeper in Go "Hello World"

So on Day-7, we just took a little overview of the Go programming and our first Go program. Today we will have a deeper look into that.

## Compilation in Go
Languages like Python, Go, and JavaScript are high-level languages, which means they are human readable. But what about the machine? We are writing programmes in our readable language (which is Go syntax), but the machine only reads 0's and 1's.

Here the compiler arrives as a saviour. It converts our Go file into a binary executable file, which our machine can easily understand. And this process of converting human-readable to machine code is called **Compilation**. 

## More about packages
The last day we saw packages, but it was just like a summary. Let's see more of it. Packages are nothing more than a bunch of Go files in the same directory. If you see complex Go programs, you will find that there are multiple folders containing multiple Go files.

How would you use a calculator or any other type of math function in your program, such as log, sin(), cos(), and so on? Will you create it from the start? No! Then how about you already have that programme available in the same directory? You just need to import them as a package.

That's what a package do, we use packages so we can reuse other people's code.

So this was all about diving deeper in the Hello world code.
