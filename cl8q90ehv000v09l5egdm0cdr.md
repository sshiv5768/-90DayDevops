## Importance of Linux in DevOps - Day 11

On the last day, we checked user input and formatted output in Go. Now we are moving to a completely different topic and the next phase of DevOps, which is Linux. Hey, but why are you skipping Go? I am not skipping Go. Actually, we just took a surface look of Go.

I've already created a separate repo called [#15DaysofGo](https://github.com/sshiv5768/15DaysOfGo). Check out so you will get a complete idea of Go Lang.

## Why Linux and DevOps? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Although Windows is now the most popular operating system on the market, Linux offers unmatched scalability and capability. Linux can be customized, which is very crucial for DevOps.

It enables you to create design and security applications suited to a given development environment.
And most of the software delivery pipelines use Linux-based servers.

But it has a lot of different distributions in the market. Which one to use is the main issue. Here are some of its distributions best suited for DevOps:

- Ubuntu
- Centos
- Fedora
- Debian

I would suggest to start with **Ubuntu** because it is a good start for devops practitioners.

You can download the **ISO** file of Ubuntu from its [official site](https://www.linux.org/pages/download/). You can either go dual boot where you can use both **Linux** and **Windows** on the same system, or you can do a single boot where you only run **Linux**. 

The best way is to create a Linux virtual machine and run it in VirtualBox. It will save that OS jump time that you would face in dual boot. You can use **Hashicorp Vagrant** to create a virtual machine and manage it. Checkout [this](https://bit.ly/3SPfZj8) to see the whole process of creating a VM using a vagrant file.
