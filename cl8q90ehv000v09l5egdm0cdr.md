Although Windows is now the most popular operating system on the market, Linux offers unmatched scalability and capability. Linux can be customized, which is very crucial for DevOps.

It enables you to create design and security applications suited to a given development environment.
And most of the software delivery pipelines use Linux-based servers.

But it has a lot of different distributions in the market. Which one to use is the main issue. Here are some of its distributions best suited for DevOps:
- Ubuntu
- Centos
- Fedora
- Debian

 You can download the **iso** file of linux from its [official site](https://www.linux.org/pages/download/). You can either go dual boot where you can use both **Linux** and **Windows** on the same system and can do a single boot where you only run **Linux**.
