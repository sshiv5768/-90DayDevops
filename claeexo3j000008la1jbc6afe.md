# Day-37 Basics Git Commands (Practically)

Okay, so the theoretical stuff is over; now let's get our hands dirty with Git commands. I will cover most of the Git commands in a single practical.

### Prerequisites
- Create a Github account
- Install Git on your local machine. ( Checkout previous [day36](https://sshivlal.hashnode.dev/day-36-installation-and-basics-of-git) blog for installation process)


### 1: Create a Github Account
To do this practical, you need a [Github]( https://github.com/) account. It is a code hosting platform for collaboration and version control. It is not the only one available on the market.

Here are a few alternatives:
- [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/product)
- [Gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/)
- [Beanstalk](https://beanstalkapp.com/)
- [Gitkraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/)

### 2: Create New Repository
 After creating a Github account, create a new repository and name it as **GitDemoRepo**.
It is up to you whether you want to make your repository **public** or **private**. I am making it public so that everyone has access to it.

If you want to give a long description of your project, you can do that using `README.md` file. It basically shows how project works, steps to use this project, project use-cases, etc.

I added `README.md` file with a few description lines.

### 3: Clone the Repository to Your Local Machine
In general terms, "cloning" means making a copy of the original repository on your local machine.

If you're a Linux user like me, then you can directly use Git in your terminal. But if you are a Windows user, you would have the option of using **Git Bash ** terminal.  We will use ``git clone`` command to clone our remote repository to our local machine.

First we ensure that Git is properly installed or not using ``git --verison``. I want to create this cloned folder on my desktop, so I am changing the current directory. Now type ``git clone <repository_url>``

The repository URL can be found by clicking the **code** button on github.

Copy that https path and run the command. Once your local repository has been created, check it. Here, I don't need to use  ``git init`` because this folder is already initialized as **git repository*. Do you want to double-check? type ``git init``

It says it is already initialized, and it will reinitialize it.

### 4: Make some changes in the local repository. 

Now it's time to make some changes in the local repository and append those changes to the remote repository.

I am going to create a new file  ``p1.txt`` in **GitDemoRepo** using ``cat `` command. In Windows, you can do it directly by just going into the folder and making a new text file. That's it.

Now let's see the repo status by using ``git status``.

It says my current local repository branch is **main** and it has some untracked files( which we just created). To add those files to the tracked code history, you need to type ``git add file_name``.

### 5: Push your changes to remote repo

As we learned in the previous Day 36 blog, after using ``git add file_name`` your changes are moved to **staged area**. Now commit these changes using  ``git commit`` and push them to the remote repository using  ``git push  ``.


![Screenshot from 2022-11-13 01-31-01.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1668283270995/O5_XzSYbz.png align="left")

If I type git commit then it says that  `unknown author identity` why it is showing that because git doesn't know who you are to identify you it requires your credentials. Which credentials ? The same one you used to set up your GitHub account.

Enter your GitHub account ``username`` and your ``email``( the same mail that you used for GitHub). It will create a global user with these credentials. If you want to change the user, you have to provide credentials with  ``git config``.

Now try  ``git commit`` It will show a screen like this where you type the commit message and your changes are committed. (You can also see where your commits messages are stored.)

![Screenshot from 2022-11-13 02-10-03.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1668285628788/IbTJ9R7O4.png align="left")

It's time to push your changes to the remote repository. Type  ``git push``. It will request a **GitHub username and password**. But there is one twist here: Github has removed password authentication in **2021**, so you can't push changes with a password.

Now, to be authenticated in this process, you have to use a **PAT (private access token)** which you can create following the process mentioned in the first [answer].(https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68775869/message-support-for-password-authentication-was-removed-please-use-a-personal)

After creating and entering your PAT, your changes are pushed to the remote repository. Refresh the repository page and you can see your changes.
