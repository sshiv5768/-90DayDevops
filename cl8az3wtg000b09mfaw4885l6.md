## Introduction to CI/CD üòï

In early time when **Git** and **Github-actions** were not present, software engineers manually test their code and then depoly their project on production servers.

Later after if anything happens with the code like code broken or bug in the code then they have to face downtime with their website or app.

So that to get rid of this problem, CI/CD is introduced which means continous inegration and continous delivery. In CI/CD we create a pipline of autonomus tasks for our project like testing, deploying, etc.

There are various tools available in the market to create and deploy CI/CD piplines like `Github actions`, `Jenkins`, `CircleCI`, etc.

## How to start with Github Actions üöß

- Create a `.github` folder in your project folder.
- Create a `workflows` folder in that folder.
- If you create any `.yml` file in that workflows folder then it will be considered as a workflow.
- Let's create `test.yml` file in that folder. This file is now considered as a Github action.
- You can verify it by going to repository's action tab and you will see that new action is listed there.

## YAML - Yet Another Markup Language üíª

YAML is a data serialization language that is often used for writing configuaration files. It is much similar like `JSON`, but it is more readable.
You can consider it as a superset of JSON which has easy syntax. There are no usual format symbols like braces, closing tags or sqaure brackets.
It uses `.yml` or `.yaml` extension.

We are going to use YAML for creating and applying logic for Github actions.

### Objects in YAML

Same as `JSON` objects are also present in YAML. But creating a object in `YAML` is easier. Indentation is required while you create a object.

```
myapp:
    service: dapp-blockchain
    test: script1

```

### Array in YAML

In `YAML` array syntax and working are same but with slight changes.

We use `-` to start a new value in the array.

```
myapp:
    services: dapp-blockchain
    test: script1
    array1: 
        - key1: value1
        - key2: value2

```

### Strings and Comments

For writing comments in `YAML` we use `#`.

```
# This is a comment.
myapp:
    services: dapp-blockchain
    test: script1
    array1: 
        - key1: value1
        - key2: value2

```

In `JSON` we use `""` to define a string but in `YAML` you can ignore it.

```
myapp:
    services: hello world
    test: script1

```

For multiline strings we use `|` symbol.

```
myapp:
    services: |
        i am shivlal
        let's do some good stuff
    test: script1

```

For more `YAML` specs you can refer to [yamlorg](https://yaml.org/)

## Let's Create Hello World Action üë®‚Äçüíª

Open `test.yml` file and type below code in that file. We will look into code's each part later.

```
name: helloworld
on: [push]
jobs:
  print-hello: 
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo "Hello Contributor!"
      - run: echo "Thanks for pushing changes."

```

Now, let's do code breakdown. `name` as it suggest it gives you name of the workflow. Here our workflow name is `helloworld`.

Next one is `on` which asks you the name of Github event that triggers the workflow. Here i gave `push` as a keyword value so whenever i push changes it will perform some jobs.

`jobs` descirbes the jobs or tasks that your workflow will perform on mentioned Github events. You can define multiple jobs in this section. Each job will run sequentially one by one.

`print-hello` is our `job_id`. Each job runs in runner environment specified by `runs-on`.

Now define your `steps` that you want to run in this job. Here we want to print 'Hello Contributor!' so `run: echo "Hello Contributor!"`.

As we discussed in `YAML` about arrays, here `steps` is an array so we used `-` to add multiple job steps.

Remember we use `BASH` commands to describe our steps in workflow.

Now come back to your repo and go to your `Actions` tab. You will see a workflow listed there with :heavy_check_mark: and last commit name. Click on that and you will see `print-hello` job.


![jobs.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1663725137358/k1W5whFlQ.png align="left")

Click on that and you will see a list of steps completed after you pushed your changes. Your desired output is also there in second step.
