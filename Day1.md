## Day-1 Introduction to DevOps

So, finally I got chance to start #90DaysOfDevOps challenge. I was waiting for this moment from very long time 🤩.

Will follow Michael Cade's [#90DaysOfDevOps](https://github.com/MichaelCade/90DaysOfDevOps) for references and resources. Road map will be same as described in the repository. 

## Day-1

### What is DevOps?😟
I started with a basic intro about DevOps and what is the role of DevOps engineer. From what i learned today, here's my definition for DevOps.

" DevOps is a combination of various tools and methods which helps your organization to bring applications and services faster in the market."
 
Let's take an example of e-commerce startup which is struggling with lower growth ratio and wants to go globally. But with their current strategies they can't go globally. They need to change it and move to DevOps. They need to move their applications to cloud, need to deploy their apps on VMs and containers and for scaling and managing that containers they need to have good amount of knowledge of tools like Docker(Containerization), Kubernetes(Container Orchestration), Jenkins(For CI\CD), Ansible(For configuration management), Terraform(Infrastructure as a Code), etc.

This how they could go globally by applying combination of methods and tools.

### Role of DevOps Engineer👨‍💻
DevOps engineer is a person who works from both side development and operations. Suppose development team wants to release a new feature and operations team wants to maintain the stability of the whole application, then a DevOps engineer can perform the tasks which reduce the complexity of this whole process by applying best practices and tools.
