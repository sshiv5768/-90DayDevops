## Day-6 Programming language for DevOps

Ok, so now I am feeling like my learning curve is going from theoretical part to practical part. On day-6, I figured out why a programming language is needed for DevOps.

# Why is programming needed in DevOps?Â 
As you know, in DevOps we mostly use tools for automated tests, for deployment, for monitoring, and so on. But most of the tools are designed and built in either Python or Go. So if you have essential programming knowledge, you can understand how those tools are working. Also, understand what improvements are needed in the process.

One reason was that now let's move to another one. Suppose you and your developer team are working on a project and you are explaining to them how to automate the workflow. But the problem here is that you don't know any programming languages, so you won't be able to make them relate to the workflow. So in this case, you should have a better understanding of any Python or Go language.

Mostly, it is a project's demand for which language to choose for DevOps. However, most people are currently learning the GO programming language for Devops. When working on Kubernetes-related projects, Go is useful, and Python is useful when working on automation projects such as CI/CD. But that doesn't mean that you have to learn two of them. Just choose any of them.

# Why Go?
Both languages have their own use cases so I don't want to start a comparison war. Currently Go is very popular term in DevOps world. According to recent [Stackoverflow Survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2021#most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted-language-want) Go is currently trending at forth position at most wanted scripting and markup language.

We will move with Python during this challenge.
